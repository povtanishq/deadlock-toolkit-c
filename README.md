Deadlock Toolkit in C

This project demonstrates deadlock concepts using C programs.
It is designed for learning Operating System deadlock handling.

Progress Log:
Day 1: Repository setup
Day 2: Core implementation of deadlock algorithms
Day 3: Added test cases
Day 4: Documentation and code cleanup

Features:
- Banker's Algorithm
- Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)
- Deadlock detection
- Modular C code

How to Run:
Compile the required C file using gcc and execute it.
Example:
gcc bankers.c -o bankers
./bankers
